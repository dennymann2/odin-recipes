# Odin Recipes Webpage

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This is my inaugural venture into web development, serving both as a practical application and a testament to my budding skills.

This project draws inspiration from **The Odin Project**, a renowned platform that aids aspiring developers in their journey. As a computer science student, I'm fervent about diversifying my knowledge and delving deeper into the vast realms of web development.
