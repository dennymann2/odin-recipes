    <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>First, we're going to start with the roux. Melt the butter over medium low heat. </li>
    <li>Add the flour and whisk the butter and flour together in the pan until the mixture turns a golden brown.</li>
    <li>Add the garam masala and black pepper and stir to combine, then add the tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce and combine. Continue to cook until it becomes thick and paste-like. Remove from heat and set aside until the meat and veggies are ready.</li>
    <li>Combine yeast, water, and sugar in a bowl. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, until foamy.</li>
    <li>Add the rest of the dough ingredients and knead for 8-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cover with a dish towel and allow dough to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 to 1Â½ hours.  If it's cool in the kitchen, I frequently turn on a stove top burner, and let the dough sit on the counter near it to help the rising process.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Let rest for 10 minutes (make sure not to let them dry out, cover them with a damp paper towel or two).</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in your pan.  Pat the beef down with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture, sprinkle some salt and pepper on the meat, and dust with a bit of flour.  Once the pan is hot, add your meat, cooking for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until nice and brown.  Then, put the meat into a bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a pan, and saute onion and garlic.  While sauteing, grind the cardamom and anise.</li>
    <li>Add the browned beef, wine, water, carrots, potatoes, salt, apple puree, cardamom, anise, and bay leaf, and then bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
    <li>Turn the heat down to medium low and simmer partially covered until the carrots are tender (about 45 minutes).</li>
    <li>Add in the curry roux that you set aside in step 3 and the chocolate, and stir until the roux and liquid in the pan combine and thicken into a nice curry sauce.  Set aside to cool, and don't forget to remove the bay leaf.</li>
    <li>Dust your hands with flour!  Flatten the dough balls into a round disc, place a spoonful of filling in the middle, and wrap wrap the edges around the filling. Gently shape each dough ball into a bun.</li>
    <li>In a frying pan, heat about an inch of oil (vegetable, canola, or sunflower oil are preferred). Add the buns, however many will fit in your pan at a time. Fry them on medium/low until golden brown, turning over to cook each side.</li>
    <li>Let them cool.</li>
</ol>
