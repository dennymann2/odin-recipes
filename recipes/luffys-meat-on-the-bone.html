    <li>Make chicken drumstick “tulips.” Use kitchen scissors to cut the meat loose from the handle end of the drumstick. Roll the meat down the bone until it is fully inside-out at the end.</li>
    <li>Soak the breadcrumbs in milk. Knead mix in a bowl, then add breadcrumbs and knead again.</li>
    <li>Fold the meaty end of the drumstick around a hard-boiled egg. If the meat doesn't cover well enough, add cuts to loosen it up. Oil hands lightly and cover drumstick and egg with step ② breadcrumb mixture.</li>
    <li>Bake at 400°F (200°C) for 15–20 minutes, watching carefully.</li>
